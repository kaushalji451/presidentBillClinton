            <p className="mb-2 text-[17px] leading-relaxed text-gray-100">
              Shri Alok Anand Tripathi, a renowned senior astrologer, social worker, and businessman,
              was born during the Mahakumbh in the mid-80s into a distinguished family of scholars and
              spiritual leaders of Varanasi. Rooted in tradition yet guided by modern education, he
              achieved excellence in music, earning Sangeet & Tabla Visharad, and later completed
              B.Tech from VIT and an MBA from London. In 2013, he received Guru Diksha and dedicated
              himself to Vedic studies, astrology, and the service of societyâ€”offering guidance to
              countless individuals, including prominent personalities across India and abroad. As the
              Custodian of Daiv-Prashna and founder of multiple ventures, including Invent-Tree and
              Golden Ghaf, he has balanced spirituality with entrepreneurship. With the formation of
              Anandvan Trust, he continues to lead as a beacon of wisdom, service, and inspiration
              for future generations.
